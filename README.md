Karate Kihon Analyzer

Offline Python engine for analyzing karate kihon videos using MediaPipe Pose.

The MVP focuses on one specific exercise:

- 10 alternating Jodan punches
- Side-view camera setup
- Maximum extension (impact frame) analysis
- Angle-based scoring against the practitioner's own chin height
- Annotated snapshot generation for every punch

All processing runs locally on the user's computer.

---

Vision

The long-term goal is to build a computer vision engine that can help karate practitioners improve their technique using only a smartphone or webcam.

The project starts with a small, well-defined MVP to validate that pose estimation can reliably analyze traditional karate kihon exercises.

Future versions may support:

- Chudan punches
- Gedan punches
- Speed drills
- Random targets
- Kicks
- Kata analysis
- Live mobile applications

---

MVP Scope (Locked v1.0)

The MVP supports:

- Jodan-zuki only
- Side-view video only
- Single practitioner
- Fixed camera position
- Offline analysis of recorded videos
- 10 alternating punches
- Left/right arm detection
- Impact frame extraction
- Angle-based scoring
- Annotated snapshot generation

The MVP intentionally excludes:

- Real-time analysis
- Mobile applications
- Chudan or Gedan targets
- Kicks
- Power measurement
- Guard hand analysis
- Hip rotation analysis
- Historical statistics

---

Kihon Exercise

The supported drill is:

Yoi

Start:
Left arm extended
Right hand in Hikite

Jodan-zuki

1
Right punch
Left hand to Hikite

2
Left punch
Right hand to Hikite

3
Right punch
Left hand to Hikite

...

10
Left punch
Right hand to Hikite

The arms continuously alternate without resetting between punches.

---

Impact Frame Definition

The impact frame is defined as:

«The frame where the active punching arm reaches maximum extension and its forward movement stops.»

This frame becomes the single source of truth for:

- Angle analysis
- Snapshot generation
- Session reports
- Debugging

---

Scoring Model

The ideal Jodan target is the practitioner's own chin height.

The system creates an ideal line:

Active Shoulder → Chin

The actual punch line is:

Active Shoulder → Active Wrist

The angular difference determines the score.

Scoring Thresholds

Deviation| Result
0–3°| Perfect
3–7°| Good
7–12°| Acceptable
12°+| Miss

The analysis also determines whether the punch was:

- Too high
- Too low

Planned Output

Session Report

{
  "video": "kihon-test.mp4",
  "total_punches": 10,
  "punches": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "expected_arm": "right",
      "detected_arm": "right",
      "result": "good",
      "deviation_degrees": -4.2,
      "snapshot": "snapshots/punch-001-right-jodan.png"
    }
  ]
}

Snapshot Images

Every punch produces an annotated image showing:

- Body landmarks
- Chin reference point
- Ideal punch line (green)
- Actual punch line (red)
- Deviation angle
- Result classification

---

Running the Analyzer

Planned command:

python -m karate_analyzer analyze input/kihon-test.mp4 --output output/

Example output:

Punch 1: Right Jodan - Good (4° low)
Punch 2: Left Jodan - Perfect (2° high)
...

Session complete

Perfect: 4
Good: 5
Acceptable: 1
Miss: 0
